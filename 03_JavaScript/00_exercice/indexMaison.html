/*
Sure, here are ten algorithmic problems you can solve using JavaScript:

Reverse a String: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.

Palindrome Check: Write a function to check if a given string is a palindrome or not.

FizzBuzz: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to n. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

Factorial: Write a function to calculate the factorial of a given number.

Find the Largest Number in an Array: Write a function to find and return the largest number in a given array of numbers.

Check for Prime Numbers: Write a function that takes a number as input and returns true if it's a prime number, false otherwise.

Count Vowels in a String: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string.

Merge Two Sorted Arrays: Write a function that merges two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.

Remove Duplicates from an Array: Write a function that removes duplicate elements from an array and returns a new array without duplicates.

Calculate Fibonacci Sequence: Write a function to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a certain number of terms.

Reverse a String: This problem involves taking a string as input and returning the string reversed. For example, if the input is "hello", the output should be "olleh".

Palindrome Check: A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). For example, "racecar" and "madam" are palindromes. The task is to write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome.

FizzBuzz: FizzBuzz is a classic programming problem. For numbers from 1 to n, print "Fizz" for multiples of three, "Buzz" for multiples of five, and "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are multiples of both three and five.

Factorial: The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, the factorial of 5 (written as 5!) is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. The task is to write a function to calculate the factorial of a given number.

Find the Largest Number in an Array: Given an array of numbers, the task is to find and return the largest number in the array.

Check for Prime Numbers: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The task is to write a function that takes a number as input and returns true if it's a prime number, and false otherwise.

Count Vowels in a String: The task is to write a function that takes a string as input and returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string.

Merge Two Sorted Arrays: Given two sorted arrays, the task is to merge them into a single sorted array without using any extra space.

Remove Duplicates from an Array: Given an array of elements, the task is to write a function that removes duplicate elements from the array and returns a new array without duplicates.

Calculate Fibonacci Sequence: The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The task is to write a function to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a certain number of terms.
